### Hi there wanderer 👋🏼

💬 About me

I am deeply passionate about programming, building things and always up for exchanging ideas and indulging in a few thought bubbles. Artificial intelligence facinates me: the unexplored recesses of human ingenuity, the augmentation of our collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The road is long and winding, but I hope it would provide a window into understanding our own cognition along the way.

To that end, I work with machine/deep learning paradigms and am currently a Research Fellow at [SoDa Laboratories](https://www.monash.edu/business/soda-labs/home), in the Department of Business and Economics at Monash University. In terms of research, I work on [neural networks architectures](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64984-5_28) and applied ML in PolySci domain. I studied Mechanical Engineering and subsequently Data Science for my Bachelors and Masters respectively. In my prior life, I built and shipped predictive models to production.

In my spare time, you might find me playing the guitar, video games, listening to a plethora of music, reading or very occassionally, sketching. I also love hiking and exploring nature in general which is something I wish I have more time for in the future!

If you would like to chat or collaborate please feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:satya.borg@gmail.com). Where there are synergies, creativity oft follows.
