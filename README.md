### Greetings, wanderer

I am deeply passionate about programming, building things and always up for exchanging ideas and indulging in a few thought bubbles. Artificial intelligence fascinates me: the unexplored recesses of human ingenuity, the augmentation of our collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The road is long and winding, but I hope it will provide a window into understanding our own cognition along the way.

If you would like to chat or collaborate please feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:satya.borg@gmail.com).
Where there are synergies, creativity often follows.
