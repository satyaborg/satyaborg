### Greetings wanderer.

I am deeply passionate about programming, building things and always up for exchanging ideas and indulging in a few thought bubbles. Artificial intelligence fascinates me: the unexplored recesses of human ingenuity, the augmentation of our collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The road is long and winding, but I hope it will provide a window into understanding our own cognition along the way.

To that end, I work with machine/deep learning paradigms and am currently a Data Scientist at Mutinex. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Monash University where I researched in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Interpretable/Explainable AI, learning algorithms among others. I studied Mechanical Engineering and subsequently Data Science for my Bachelors and Masters respectively.

If you would like to chat or collaborate please feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:satya.borg@gmail.com).
Where there are synergies, creativity often follows.
